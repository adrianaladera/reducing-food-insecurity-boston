Reducing food insecurity is crucial because it directly impacts individual well-being, community stability, and societal progress. Food insecurity leads to severe health consequences, including malnutrition, weakened immune systems, and chronic diseases. For children, it affects cognitive development and academic performance, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Beyond health, food insecurity contributes to social inequities and economic instability, increasing healthcare costs and reducing productivity. This is especially relevant in the Greater Boston Area, where the city of Boston alone has a food insecurity rate of 43% despite being one of the most highly-educated cities in the U.S. This ironic disparity between food poverty and education highlights an issue of essential needs such as food. By addressing food insecurity, societies can promote equity, improve public health outcomes, and build stronger, more resilient communities where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. This fundamental step not only supports humanitarian goals but also fosters long-term economic growth and stability.

In this work, we implement a robust adaptive facility location model formulation with budget uncertainty sets that aims to reduce the food insecurity rate in the Greater Boston Area while optimizing costs. The model determines optimal facility locations in high-need areas, calculates the most efficient distribution routes from warehouses to facilities, and ensures that essential nutrient requirements are met. Through this framework, the project provides a sustainable, cost-effective, and health-conscious strategy for food distribution that can support food banks, non-profits, and government agencies in maximizing their impact within budget constraints. Beyond Boston, this model can be adapted and scaled for broader applications, potentially improving food distribution systems in other cities or regions facing similar challenges.
